216,dataset.8666844,10.1371/journal.pone.0123628,Spatial Heterogeneity Regulates Plant-Pollinator Networks across Multiple Landscape Scales,"Mutualistic plant-pollinator interactions play a key role in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning. In a community, the combination of these interactions can generate emergent properties, e.g., robustness and resilience to disturbances such as fluctuations in populations and extinctions. Given that these systems are hierarchical and complex, environmental changes must have multiple levels of influence. In addition, changes in habitat quality and in the landscape structure are important threats to plants, pollinators and their interactions. However, despite the importance of these phenomena for the understanding of biological systems, as well as for conservation and management strategies, few studies have empirically evaluated these effects at the network level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of local conditions and landscape structure at multiple scales on the characteristics of plant-pollinator networks. This study was conducted in agri-natural lands in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. Pollinators were collected in 27 sampling units distributed orthogonally along a gradient of proportion of agriculture and landscape diversity. The Akaike information criterion was used to select models that best fit the metrics for network characteristics, comparing four hypotheses represented by a set of a priori candidate models with specific combinations of the proportion of agriculture, the average shape of the landscape elements, the diversity of the landscape and the structure of local vegetation. The results indicate that a reduction of habitat quality and landscape heterogeneity can cause species loss and decrease of networks nestedness. These structural changes can reduce robustness and resilience of plant-pollinator networks what compromises the reproductive success of plants, the maintenance of biodiversity and the pollination service stability. We also discuss the possible explanations for these relationships and the implications for landscape planning in agricultural areas.",Public Library of Science,2015-04-09,2015,Eduardo Freitas Moreira; Danilo Boscolo; Blandina Felipe Viana,pub.1041348357,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.8666844,https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Spatial_Heterogeneity_Regulates_Plant_Pollinator_Networks_across_Multiple_Landscape_Scales_/1372798,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications",15 Life on Land

208,dataset.5084,10.5061/dryad.640v21f,Data from: Insect pollination is at least as important for marketable crop yield as plant quality in a seed crop,"The sustainability of agriculture can be improved by integrating management of ecosystem services, such as insect pollination, into farming practices. However, large‐scale adoption of ecosystem services‐based practices in agriculture is lacking, possibly because growers undervalue the benefits of ecosystem services compared to those of conventional management practices. Here we show that, under representative real‐world conditions, pollination and plant quality made similar contributions to marketable seed yield of hybrid leek (Allium porrum). Relative to the median, a 25% improvement of plant quality and pollination increased crop value by an estimated $18 007 and $17 174 ha−1 respectively. Across five crop lines, bumblebees delivered most pollination services, while other wild pollinator groups made less frequent but nevertheless substantial contributions. Honeybees actively managed for pollination services did not make significant contributions.

Mutualisms evolve through the matching of functional traits between partners, such as tongue length of pollinators and flower tube depth of plants. Long-tongued pollinators specialize on flowers with deep corolla tubes, whereas shorter-tongued pollinators generalize across tube lengths. Losses of functional guilds because of shifts in global climate may disrupt mutualisms and threaten partner species. We found that in two alpine bumble bee species, decreases in tongue length have evolved over 40 years. Co-occurring flowers have not become shallower, nor are small-flowered plants more prolific. We argue that declining floral resources because of warmer summers have favored generalist foraging, leading to a mismatch between shorter-tongued bees and the longer-tubed plants they once pollinated.",DRYAD,2016-01-01,2016,"Miller-Struttmann, Nicole E.; Geib, Jennifer C.; Franklin, James D.; Kevan, Peter G.; Holdo, Ricardo M.; Ebert-May, Diane; Lynn, Austin M.; Kettenbach, Jessica A.; Hedrick, Elizabeth; Galen, Candace",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.70446,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.10278,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",

This land use change alters the quality, availability, and configuration of habitat resources, affecting the community composition of plants and insects, as well as their interactions with each other. Landscapes dominated by agriculture are known to support a lower abundance and diversity of pollinators and frequently larger populations of key herbivore pests. In turn, insect communities subsidized by agriculture may spill into remaining natural habitats with consequences for wild plants persisting in (semi) natural habitats. Adaptive responses by wild plants may allow them to persist in highly modified landscapes; yet how landscape-mediated variation in insect communities affects wild plant traits related to reproduction and defense remains largely unknown. We synthesize the evidence for plant trait changes across land use gradients and propose potential mechanisms by which landscape-mediated changes in insect communities may be driving these trait changes. Further, we present results from a common garden experiment on three wild Brassica species demonstrating variation in both defensive and reproductive traits along an agricultural land use gradient. Our framework illustrates the potential for plant adaptation under land use change and predicts how defense and reproduction trait expression may shift in low diversity landscapes.

An increasing human population is encroaching upon and deteriorating pollinator habitats. Thus the population persistence of pollinating insects and their associated ecosystem services may depend upon on man-made novel habitats; however, their importance for ecosystem services is barely understood. We tested if man-made infrastructure (railway embankments) in an agricultural landscape establishes novel habitats that support large populations of pollinators (bees, butterflies, hoverflies) when compared to typical habitats for these insects, i.e., semi-natural grasslands. We also identified key environmental factors affecting the species richness and abundance of pollinators on embankments. Species richness and abundance of bees and butterflies were higher for railway embankments than for grasslands. The occurrence of bare (non-vegetated) ground on embankments positively affected bee species richness and abundance, but negatively affected butterfly populations. Species richness and abundance of butterflies positively depended on species richness of native plants on embankments, whereas bee species richness was positively affected by species richness of non-native flowering plants. The density of shrubs on embankments negatively affected the number of bee species and their abundance. Bee and hoverfly species richness were positively related to wood cover in a landscape surrounding embankments. This is the first study showing that railway embankments constitute valuable habitat for the conservation of pollinators in farmland. Specific conservation strategies involving embankments should focus on preventing habitat deterioration due to encroachment of dense shrubs and maintaining grassland vegetation with patches of bare ground.",Public Library of Science,2014-07-23,2014,Dawid Moroń; Piotr Skórka; Magdalena Lenda; Elżbieta Rożej-Pabijan; Marta Wantuch; Joanna Kajzer-Bonk; Waldemar Celary; Łukasz Emil Mielczarek; Piotr Tryjanowski,pub.1029472249,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.8713661,https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Railway_Embankments_as_New_Habitat_for_Pollinators_in_an_Agricultural_Landscape_/1115353,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications",

This plant had an excellent potential of self-seeding and competitiveness towards weed competitors. C. transsylvanica prevented from entomophilous pollination showed inbreeding depression, with a decrease in seed-set and accumulation of seed energy reserves. However, C. transsylvanica did not appear to be vulnerable in terms of pollination biology since it had a wide range of pollinators including bees, hoverflies and Lepidoptera. C. transsylvanica was visited mainly by honeybees and bumblebees and these latter pollinators increased their visits on C. transsylvanica flowers during early autumn.

160,dataset.24971,10.5061/dryad.d0f3b,Data from: Pollinator body size mediates the scale at which land use drives crop pollination services,"1. Ecosystem services to agriculture, such as pollination, rely on natural areas adjacent to farmland to support organisms that provide services. Native insect pollinators depend on natural or semi-natural land surrounding farms for nesting and alternative foraging resources. Despite interest in conserving pollinators through habitat restoration, the scale at which land use affects pollinators and thus crop pollination services is not well understood. 2. We measured abundance of native, wild bee pollinators and the pollination services they provided to highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. crops at 16 sites that varied in the proportion of surrounding agricultural land cover at both the field scale (300 m radius) and the landscape scale (1500 m radius). We designed our study such that agricultural land cover at the field scale was uncorrelated with agricultural cover at the landscape scale across sites. We used model selection to determine which spatial scale better predicted aggregate bee abundance, abundance of large versus small bees, and crop pollination services. 3. We found that, overall, bees responded more strongly to farm-scale than to landscape-scale land cover, but the scale at which land cover had the strongest effect varied by bee body size. Large bees showed a negative response to increasing agricultural cover at both scales, but were most strongly affected by the landscape scale. Small bees were negatively affected by agricultural land cover but only at the farm scale, while they had a small positive response to agricultural cover at the landscape scale. 4. Aggregate pollination services from native bees were more strongly influenced by local agricultural cover, due to the combined effects of both large and small bees responding at that scale. 5. Synthesis and applications. Bee abundance and pollination services were strongly determined by farm-scale agricultural cover, suggesting that farm-scale set-asides may provide significant benefits to pollination services. Further, we found that pollinators respond differently to land use depending on body size, but all groups of bees benefit from decreasing agricultural cover at the farm scale. Therefore, small-scale modifications to habitat can have significant impacts on both pollinator abundance and pollination services to crop plants.",DRYAD,2014-01-01,2014,"Benjamin, Faye; Reilly, James; Winfree, Rachael",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.24971,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.d0f3b,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications",
159,dataset.28216551,10.5061/dryad.bg79cnp9g,Proximity to crop relatives determines patterns of natural selection in a wild sunflower,"Abiotic and biotic heterogeneity result in divergent patterns of natural selection in nature, with important consequences for fundamental evolutionary processes including local adaptation, speciation and diversification. However, increasing amounts of the global terrestrial surface are homogenized by agriculture (which covers nearly 50% of terrestrial vegetated land surface) and other anthropogenic activities. Agricultural intensification leads to highly simplified biotic communities for many taxa, which may alter natural selection through biotic selective agents. In particular, the presence of crops may alter selection on traits of closely related wild relatives via shared mutualists and antagonists such as pollinators and herbivores. We asked how the presence of crop sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) alters natural selection on reproductive traits of wild sunflowers (H. a. texanus). Across two years and multiple sites, we planted replicated paired populations of wild H. a. texanus bordering sunflower crop fields vs. approximately 2.5 km away. We measured fitness, floral traits, and interactions of the plants with insect pollinators and seed predators. We found limited evidence that proximity to crop sunflowers altered selection on individual traits, as total or direct selection differed by proximity for only three of eleven traits: ray length (a marginally significant effect), Isophrictis (Gelechiidae, moth) attack, and Neolasioptera (Cecidomyiidae, midge) attack.

157,dataset.36625,10.5061/dryad.2fqz612m2,Enhancing pollination is more effective than increased conventional agriculture inputs for improving watermelon yields,"Agricultural practices to improve yields in small-scale farms in Africa usually focus on improving growing conditions for the crops by applying fertilizers, irrigation and/or pesticides. This may however, have limited effect on yield if the availability of effective pollinators is too low. In this study, we established an experiment to test whether soil fertility, soil moisture and/or pollination was limiting watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) yields in Northern Tanzania. We subjected the experimental field to common farming practices while we treated selected plants with extra fertilizer applications, increased irrigation and/or extra pollination in a three-way factorial experiment. One week before harvest, we assessed yield from each plant, quantified as the number of mature fruits and their weights. We also assessed fruit shape since this may affect the market price. For the first fruit ripening on each plant, we also assessed sugar content (brix) and flesh colour as measures of fruit quality for human consumption. Extra pollination significantly increased the probability of a plant producing a second fruit of a size the farmer could sell at the market, and also the fruit sugar content, whereas additional fertilizer applications or increased irrigation did not improve yields. In addition, we did not find significant effects of increased fertilizer or watering on fruit sugar, weight or colour. We concluded that, insufficient pollination service is limiting watermelon yields in our experiment and we suggest that this may be a common situation in sub-Saharan Africa. It is therefore critically important that small-scale farmers understand the role of pollinators and understand their importance for agricultural production. Agricultural policies to improve yields in developing countries should therefore also include measures to improve pollination services by giving education and advisory services to farmers on how to develop pollinator friendly habitats in agricultural landscapes.",DRYAD,2020-01-01,2020,"Sawe, Thomas; Eldegard, Katrine; Totland, Ørjan; Macrice, Samora; Nielsen, Anders",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.36625,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2fqz612m2,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3002 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 3008 Horticultural Production",

However, tracking the primary exposure route for bees in the field has proven to be a major logistical challenge, impeding efforts to restore pollinator health in agricultural landscapes. We quantified neonicotinoid concentrations and botanical species composition in 357 pollen samples collected from 114 commercial honey bee colonies placed along a gradient of agricultural intensity between June and September. Neonicotinoid concentrations increased through the season, peaking at the end of August. As a result, concentrations in pollen were negatively associated with collection from woody and crop plants that flower early-mid season, and positively associated with collection from herbaceous plants that flower mid-late season. Higher clothianidin and thiamethoxam residues were correlated with samples containing a greater proportion of pollen collected from agricultural weeds. The percentage of agricultural land within 1,500 m was positively correlated with thiamethoxam concentration; however, this spatial relationship was far weaker than the relationship with the proportion of pollen collected from herbaceous plants. These results indicate that both plant species identity and agricultural dominance are important in determining honey bee neonicotinoid exposure through the pollen diet, but that uncultivated plants associated with agriculture are the source of the greatest acute exposure.",DRYAD,2019-01-01,2019,"Wood, Thomas; Kaplan, Ian; Zhang, Yajun; Szendrei, Zsofia",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.25837,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.913qd93,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",

Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species.

We examined how tropical deforestation affects hummingbird community structure in premontane forest patches embedded in a tropical countryside of Coto Brus Canton, Costa Rica. We captured hummingbirds in fourteen landscapes representing a gradient in patch size and forest amount, and tested for the effects of these variables on (1) hummingbird captures at flowers (pollinator availability); (2) species richness; and (3) filtering of functional traits. After accounting for sampling effects, both hummingbird availability and species richness declined by 40% and 50%, respectively, across the gradient in deforestation that we observed (9–66% forest within 1000 m). Focal patch size was the strongest predictor, even after statistically accounting for the amount of forest and matrix composition of landscapes. These reductions in availability and richness were well predicted by functional traits; morphologically specialized species with the capacity to transport long-distance outcrossed pollen and low functional redundancy within the pollinator network showed the greatest sensitivity to landscape change.

Much recent research has focused on drivers of crop-visitor diversity operating over spatial scales from fields to landscapes, such as pesticide and habitat management, while drivers operating over larger scales of continents and biogeographic realms are virtually unknown. Flower and visitor traits influence attraction of pollinators to flowers, and evolve in the context of associations that can be ancient or recent. Plants that have been adopted into agriculture have been moved widely around the world and thereby exposed to new flower visitors. Remarkably little is known of the consequence of these historical patterns for present day crop-visiting bee diversity. We analyze data from 317 studies of 27 crops worldwide and find that crops are visited by fewer bee genera outside their region of origin and outside their family’s region of origin.

Pollination, water and nutrients available to crops can influence yield, but it is not known if the nutritional value of the crop is also influenced. Almonds are an important source of critical nutrients for human health such as unsaturated fat and vitamin E. We manipulated the pollination of almond trees and the resources available to the trees, to investigate the impact on the nutritional composition of the crop. The pollination treatments were: (a) exclusion of pollinators to initiate self-pollination and (b) hand cross-pollination; the plant resource treatments were: (c) reduced water and (d) no fertilizer. In an orchard in northern California, trees were exposed to a single treatment or a combination of two (one pollination and one resource). Both the fat and vitamin E composition of the nuts were highly influenced by pollination. Lower proportions of oleic to linoleic acid, which are less desirable from both a health and commercial perspective, were produced by the self-pollinated trees. However, higher levels of vitamin E were found in the self-pollinated nuts. In some cases, combined changes in pollination and plant resources sharpened the pollination effects, even when plant resources were not influencing the nutrients as an individual treatment. This study highlights the importance of insects as providers of cross-pollination for fruit quality that can affect human health, and, for the first time, shows that other environmental factors can sharpen the effect of pollination.

Continuous availability of food resources, such as pollen, is vital for many insects that provide pollination and pest control services to agriculture. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the shared or complementary use of floral resources by such species, which hampers more effective landscape management to simultaneously promote them in agroecosystems. 2. Here, we simultaneously quantified pollen use by a bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) and a mason bee (Osmia bicornis), two bee species recognized as important crop pollinators, as well as a lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea) and a ladybeetle species (Harmonia axyridis), both common predators of crop aphids, throughout the season in 23 agricultural landscapes in Germany and Switzerland. 3. Pollen diets were more diverse and similar among C. carnea and H. axyridis compared to the two bee species, but all four species shared key pollen types early in the season such as Acer, Quercus, Salix and Prunus. All species exhibited a pronounced shift in pollen sources from primarily woody plants (mainly trees) in spring to primarily herbaceous plants in summer. The majority of pollen (overall ≥64%) came from non-agricultural plants even in crop-dominated landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of trees as pollen sources for many insect species, particularly early in the season. Our findings support incentives that promote heterogeneous agricultural landscapes including both woody and herbaceous semi-natural habitats, ensuring phenological complementarity of floral resources for insect species that can provide pollination and pest control services to agriculture.

Agriculture now constitutes 40–50% of terrestrial land use globally. By enhancing habitat suitability and connectivity, restoration within agricultural landscapes could have a major influence on biodiversity conservation. However, habitat management within intensive agricultural landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common, highly mobile generalists, rather than vulnerable or endangered species. We studied pollinator community response to small-scale habitat restoration in the intensively farmed Central Valley of California to determine whether restoration could also promote more specialized, less common, and/or less mobile species. 2. Composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental and 10 control (unrestored) sites before and after restoration of native plant hedgerows over an 8-year period, using a before-after-control-impact design. 3. We characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits [floral specialization, habitat specialization, abundance, body size, and sociality (bees only)] known to influence the response to habitat change. 4. We modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration over time as modulated by their response traits. 5. We found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of native bee and syrphid fly species, but that as hedgerows matured, they had a greater positive effect on species that were more specialized in floral and nesting resources and smaller (less mobile). 6. Synthesis and applications. Unlike previous studies that suggest habitat restoration in agricultural landscapes only benefits mobile, generalist species, our results suggest that small-scale habitat restoration can promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation. Thus, even within highly intensive agricultural landscapes, small-scale habitat restoration can be a conservation management tool.

A total of 54,955 specimens were identified using traditional taxonomic methods and bulk arthropod samples were identified through DNA metabarcoding, resulting in a total of 1077 and 2110 taxa, respectively. Species richness of most taxonomic groups as well as multidiversity and richness of pollinators increased with temporal continuity of AES types. Some groups responded to size and landscape context but multidiversity and richness of pollinators and natural enemies were not affected. AES flowering fields supported different species assemblages than calcareous grasslands, but assemblages became more similar to those in semi-natural grasslands with increasing temporal continuity. Our results indicate that AES flowering fields and semi-natural grasslands function synergistically. Flowering fields support biodiversity even when they are relatively small and in landscapes with few remaining semi-natural habitats. We, therefore, recommend a network of smaller, temporally continuous AES flowering fields of different ages combined with permanent semi-natural grasslands to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery in agricultural landscapes.",DRYAD,2021-01-01,2021,"Boetzl, Fabian A.; Krauss, Jochen; Heinze, Jonathan; Hoffmann, Hannes; Juffa, Jan; König, Sebastian; Krimmer, Elena; Prante, Maren; Martin, Emily A.; Holzschuh, Andrea; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.28215395,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.hdr7sqvh1,31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications,15 Life on Land
124,dataset.8805259,10.1371/journal.pone.0070182,Crop Pollination Exposes Honey Bees to Pesticides Which Alters Their Susceptibility to the Gut Pathogen <i>Nosema ceranae</i>,"Recent declines in honey bee populations and increasing demand for insect-pollinated crops raise concerns about pollinator shortages. Pesticide exposure and pathogens may interact to have strong negative effects on managed honey bee colonies. Such findings are of great concern given the large numbers and high levels of pesticides found in honey bee colonies. Thus it is crucial to determine how field-relevant combinations and loads of pesticides affect bee health. We collected pollen from bee hives in seven major crops to determine 1) what types of pesticides bees are exposed to when rented for pollination of various crops and 2) how field-relevant pesticide blends affect bees’ susceptibility to the gut parasite Nosema ceranae. Our samples represent pollen collected by foragers for use by the colony, and do not necessarily indicate foragers’ roles as pollinators. In blueberry, cranberry, cucumber, pumpkin and watermelon bees collected pollen almost exclusively from weeds and wildflowers during our sampling. Thus more attention must be paid to how honey bees are exposed to pesticides outside of the field in which they are placed. We detected 35 different pesticides in the sampled pollen, and found high fungicide loads. The insecticides esfenvalerate and phosmet were at a concentration higher than their median lethal dose in at least one pollen sample. While fungicides are typically seen as fairly safe for honey bees, we found an increased probability of Nosema infection in bees that consumed pollen with a higher fungicide load. Our results highlight a need for research on sub-lethal effects of fungicides and other chemicals that bees placed in an agricultural setting are exposed to.",Public Library of Science,2013-07-24,2013,Jeffery S.

We provide new data and we review previously available information on bees (Apoidea) associated with three economically important crops in Spain: melon (Cucumis melo L.), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai) and almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb). We found that, overall, 98 bee species spanning four families visit flowers of the studied crop species, and 46 additional species were sampled within the crops with pan-traps. The bee assemblages visiting melon include 7–33 species, with moderate to high importance of small Lasioglossum (Halictidae) and of honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758: Apidae), and in one case of small Ceratina: Apidae. Watermelon flowers are visited by 11–14 species of bees, with highest abundance of honey bees or of small Lasioglossum, depending on the locality. Bees collected on almond trees included 12–37 species, with the honey bee and medium-size to large Andrena (Andrenidae) and Osmia (Megachilidae) being predominant. The new samples expanded the geographical distributions of nearly one-fourth of the collected species. Diversity estimators slightly varied even within fields of the same crop, and a cluster analysis suggested both a certain overlap between melon and watermelon and a role of geographical distance on similarity among bee assemblages, though these patterns were much clearer using presence data rather than abundances. Below-ground-nesting and solitary species were more frequently collected than above-ground-nesting and eusocial species, but for melon and watermelon the highest abundances were recorded for eusocial species. Almost exclusively polylectic species visited the flowers of the three studied crops. The results of this study could help in planning conservation actions to maintain this important diversity of potential pollinators in Spanish areas covered by these crops.",Taylor & Francis Group,2021-01-08,2021,Sara Rodrigo Gómez; Concepción Ornosa; Jaime García Gila; Javier Blasco-Aróstegui; Jesús Selfa; Miguel Guara; Carlo Polidori,pub.1134463493,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.24591715,https://tandf.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Bees_and_crops_in_Spain_an_update_for_melon_watermelon_and_almond/13547255,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",

Consequently, efforts to enhance crop yields on organic farms by using effective weed control methods risk compromising positive effects of organic farming on pollinating insects. Thus, it is important to find management strategies that alleviate the trade-off between crop yields and flowering weeds on organic farms. We investigated the relationship between cereal yields, flowering weeds and bumblebees on organic and conventional arable land. We also investigated the potential of adjusting crop sowing density to benefit flowering weed species richness and floral resources to bumblebees without affecting crop yield. Floral resources and species richness of flowering weeds were higher in organic compared to conventional fields and were negatively related to crop yield in organic but not conventional fields (where the variation of floral resources and flowering weed species richness was comparatively low). Bumblebee species richness was higher in organic compared to conventional fields, and abundance was twice as high in organic as in conventional fields, but not significantly so. Yields in organic fields were two thirds of those in conventional fields. When simultaneously testing the effect of farming type (organic vs. conventional), crop yield and floral resources, only floral resources were related significantly to bumblebee abundance and species richness. A lower sowing density of the crop increased floral resources without negatively affecting crop yield. Synthesis and applications. We show that organic farming practices in cereals benefit bumblebees by allowing more flowering weeds, but at a cost in terms of lower yields. However, adjusting crop sowing density provides an opportunity to attain increased floral resources without negatively affecting crop yields. Thus, by increasing floral resources, adjusting crop sowing density may contribute to supporting high bumblebee densities, which in turn sustain pollination services to wild plants and insect-pollinated crops, such as oilseed rape and field beans, in agricultural landscapes. We suggest that sowing strategies have the potential to contribute to ecological intensification by supporting organisms that provide ecosystem services to agriculture.",DRYAD,2021-01-01,2021,"Sidemo-Holm, William; Carrié, Romain; Ekroos, Johan; Lindström, Sandra A.M.; Smith, Henrik G.",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.28223659,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.m0cfxpp3k,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

As part of a commercial operation, bee colonies are exposed to a variety of agricultural ecosystems throughout the year and a multitude of environmental variables that may affect the microbial balance of individuals and the hive. While many recent studies support the idea of a core microbiota in guts of younger in-hive bees, it is unknown whether this core is present in forager bees or the pollen they carry back to the hive. Additionally, several studies hypothesize that the foregut (crop), a key interface between the pollination environment and hive food stores, contains a set of 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that inoculate collected pollen and act in synergy to preserve pollen stores. Here, we used a combination of 454 based 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the microbial communities of forager guts, crops, and corbicular pollen and crop plate counts to show that (1) despite a very different diet, forager guts contain a core microbiota similar to that found in younger bees, (2) corbicular pollen contains a diverse community dominated by hive-specific, environmental or phyllosphere bacteria that are not prevalent in the gut or crop, and (3) the 13 LAB found in culture-based studies are not specific to the crop but are a small subset of midgut or hindgut specific bacteria identified in many recent 454 amplicon-based studies. The crop is dominated by Lactobacillus kunkeei, and Alpha 2.2 (Acetobacteraceae), highly osmotolerant and acid resistant bacteria found in stored pollen and honey. Crop taxa at low abundance include core hindgut bacteria in transit to their primary niche, and potential pathogens or food spoilage organisms seemingly vectored from the pollination environment.

Effect of flower identity and diversity on reducing aphid populations via natural enemy communities. Ecology and Evolution. Floral plantings are often used in agriculture to attract pollinator communities but they also play an important role in recruiting and establishing natural communities for natural pest control. Inconsistent effects of floral plantings for pest control may be a result of an absence of mechanistic insights and a reliance on the idea that simply increasing flower diversity will benefit these services. A more tailored set of flower species may be needed to benefit the natural enemies through provision of nectar and alternative prey. We used an outside pot experiment to investigate the effect of three flower plants (Fagopyrum esculentum, Vicia faba, Trifolium pratense) on reducing aphid pests on four different plant cultivars of barley (Hordeum vulgare), over two years. We grew the four cultivars of barley alone, next to a single flower or next to a mixture of flowers and observed aphid and natural enemy colonisation across the growing season. Aphid populations sizes were reduced on all barley cultivars grown next to a flower with stronger pest suppression when all flowers were present. Each flower species recruited a different community of non-barley aphids that, in turn, varied in their ability to establish the natural enemy populations, and subsequently the ability to reduce barley aphid populations. Overall increased pest suppression in the mixed treatments was a result of numerous weaker interactions between different flower, pest, and natural enemy species, rather than a few dominant interactions. Natural enemy communities could be enhanced by incorporating flower species that vary in their ability to attract and host alternative prey (i.e. non-pest) as well as suitable nectar provisioning. We can use our knowledge of ecological interactions to tailor floral plantings to increase the effectiveness of pest control services.",DRYAD,2021-01-01,2021,"Zytynska, Sharon; Eicher, Moritz; Fahle, Robin; Weisser, Wolfgang",,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.57848827,http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pk0p2ngps,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4103 Environmental Biotechnology",

When these predators feed on herbivorous pests, biological control is improved with the potential to increase crop yield. However, generalists often feed on predators, pollinators, and plants, which might worsen pest outbreaks and reduce fruit set. For example, weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) are major predators of several key, economically-damaging pest insects of tropical fruit and nut crops. Yet the ants also attack other predatory arthropods and important pollinators, while tending trophobiont honeydew producers like mealybugs (Pseudococcidae) that are themselves pests. Finally, ants will supplement their diet with sugars from floral and extrafloral nectaries, a form of plant feeding that presumably carries a physiological cost to the plant. Here, across previously-published experimental studies that compared treatments where ants were present vs. excluded, we summarize the effects of weaver ants on beneficial and pest insects and tree-crop productivity. Our quantitative review revealed nearly ubiquitous benefits of Oecophylla ants for tropical agriculture. Treatments with ants present generally showed lower pest densities and damage from pest insects in the families Coreidae, Miridae, Pentatomidae, and Tephritidae. Pest reduction was seen on cacao (Theobroma cacao), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), and mango (Mangifera indica) trees. The single exception to these pest reductions occurred when ants facilitated the population growth of mealybugs and other honeydew producers. In general, we found that Oecophylla ants provided the valuable ecosystem service of natural pest control to a diversity of tropical tree crops. Despite the potential for the ants to harm other predators or pollinators, evidence for these ecosystem disservices was rare and other beneficial insects co-exist well with this group of ants. Our findings bolster the general finding that ant species that tend herbivores who are not themselves pests can provide broad-reaching benefits to plant productivity. More generally, our findings are consistent with the many cases where non-pest prey bolster densities of polyphagous predators with benefits for biological control despite some degree of plant feeding by the predators.",Frontiers,2019-05-15,2019,Jessa H.

103,dataset.8739105,10.1371/journal.pone.0094482,Pesticide Residues and Bees – A Risk Assessment,"Bees are essential pollinators of many plants in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops alike. In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees.",Public Library of Science,2014-04-09,2014,Francisco Sanchez-Bayo; Koichi Goka,pub.1032369274,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.8739105,https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Pesticide_Residues_and_Bees_8211_A_Risk_Assessment_/993463,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

This land use change alters the quality, availability, and configuration of habitat resources, affecting the community composition of plants and insects, as well as their interactions with each other. Landscapes dominated by agriculture are known to support a lower abundance and diversity of pollinators and frequently larger populations of key herbivore pests. In turn, insect communities subsidized by agriculture may spill into remaining natural habitats with consequences for wild plants persisting in (semi) natural habitats. Adaptive responses by wild plants may allow them to persist in highly modified landscapes; yet how landscape-mediated variation in insect communities affects wild plant traits related to reproduction and defense remains largely unknown. We synthesize the evidence for plant trait changes across land use gradients and propose potential mechanisms by which landscape-mediated changes in insect communities may be driving these trait changes. Further, we present results from a common garden experiment on three wild Brassica species demonstrating variation in both defensive and reproductive traits along an agricultural land use gradient. Our framework illustrates the potential for plant adaptation under land use change and predicts how defense and reproduction trait expression may shift in low diversity landscapes.

However, humans also exert selection on floral traits of ornamental plants. We compared the preferences of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), and humans for flowers of snapdragon. From a cross of two species, Antirrhinum majus and Antirrhinum linkianum, we selected four Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs). We characterised scent emission from whole flowers and stamens, pollen content and viability, trichome density, floral shape, size and colour of floral parts. We tested the preferences of bumblebees, thrips, and humans for whole flowers, floral scent bouquets, stamen scent, and individual scent compounds. Humans and bumblebees showed preferences for parental species, whereas thrips preferred RILs. Colour and floral scent, in combination with other floral traits, seem relevant phenotypes for all organisms. Remarkably, visual traits override scent cues for bumblebees, although, scent is an important trait when bumblebees cannot see the flowers, and methyl benzoate was identified as a key attractant for them. The evolutionary trajectory of flowers is the result of multiple floral traits interacting with different organisms with different habits and modes of interaction.",Frontiers,2021-08-23,2021,Victoria Ruiz-Hernández; Lize Joubert; Amador Rodríguez-Gómez; Silvia Artuso; Jonathan G.

Intensification leads to the fragmentation and loss of natural habitats, native vegetation, and nesting and breeding sites. Understanding the adaptability of insects to these changing environmental conditions is critical to predicting their survival. Bumblebees, key pollinators of wild and cultivated plants, are used as model species to assess insect adaptation to anthropogenic stressors. We investigated the effects of agricultural pressures on two common European bumblebees, Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius. Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing was used to identify loci under selective pressure across agricultural-natural gradients over 97 locations in Europe. 191 unique loci in B. pascuorum and 260 in B. lapidarius were identified as under selective pressure, and associated with agricultural stressors. Further investigation suggested several candidate proteins including several neurodevelopment, muscle, and detoxification proteins, but these have yet to be validated.
